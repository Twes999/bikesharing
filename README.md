# Overview
-Present data visualizations of bike trip analysis to show stakeholders the potential positive investment for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.

# Results
-This first visual shows us that peak duration of bike trips is about 5 minutes long for users.



-The second visual shows us:
    1.) Males use a majority (108,087 riders) of the bikes with a peak duration of 5 minutes.
    2.) Even though females have less riders by count the trip duration is equivenlent to male riders of 5-6 minutes.




-The third visual is telling us that most popular time for bike usage is during week days in the typical hours of the start of a workday (7am-9am) and end of workday (5pm-6pm).



-The fourth visual shows us that even though females are using the bikes during the popular morning workday hours & end of workday hours, the vast majority of those riders during those hours are male.



-The fifth visual tells us that of the riders in the data a significant amount are subscribers to teh bike service not one time users.




-The sixth visual confirms the peak hours for riders in August are 4pm to 7pm.



-The seventh visual is shoing us the most popular starting stations that riders that their trip at. Base off this visual it looks like the more popular stations are around Grand Central Station which makes sense based off the fact that is where a large influx of people are coming from to start their day in New York City.




# Summary
-Based off the results of the data that these visuals were able to showcase, the key part in making a bike sharing program in Des Moines successful is getting potential riders to sign up for the subscription. Being able to lock someone in to the subcription and not just one time users is key. The subscription users were the vast majority of the trips taken during the work week. Being able to get into the market of riders who want to go green or save on fuel during the week when it is nice out is where we can really bring in the money.
