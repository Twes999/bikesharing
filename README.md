-The seventh visual is shoing us the most popular starting stations that riders that their trip at. Base off this visual it looks like the more popular stations are around Grand Central Station which makes sense based off the fact that is where a large influx of people are coming from to start their day in New York City.

# Summary
-Based off the results of the data that these visuals were able to showcase, the key part in making a bike sharing program in Des Moines successful is getting potential riders to sign up for the subscription. Being able to lock someone in to the subcription and not just one time users is key. The subscription users were the vast majority of the trips taken during the work week. Being able to get into the market of riders who want to go green or save on fuel during the week when it is nice out is where we can really bring in the money.
